Made in Unity 2022.1.8f1 with C#.

This project was made for my Introduction to Computer Game Development subject in my university. The development time of this project took over the course of 24 hours.
The project is a remake of the classic Pac-Man game from the Atari 2600 with changes from the original.

This project was individual work.
